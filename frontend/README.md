# Frontend

This is a Vite + React frontend. It includes a simple WalletConnect login flow (Web3Modal) and a basic UI to call the Ticketing contract.

Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Environment

- `VITE_RPC_URL` - RPC for WalletConnect (Base mainnet recommended)
- `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - deployed Ticketing contract address

Replace the placeholder Reown integration with the official AppKit per their docs.
